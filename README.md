## About Me
My name is Axel Zielonka. I am a third year Software Engineering student at Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Buenos Aires (FIUBA). I am 21 years old. I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

## Projects
Throughout these 3 years studying, I have been a part of several academic projects where I was able to put to test my knowledge, using languages such as C, C++, Python, Java and Rust. These projects vary from simple problems like file reading, to more complex ones like games. The top projects I have been a part of are:

### Duck Game Remake
A reinterpretation of the classic 'Duck Game' by Landon Podbielski. Originally a 4 person project, due to problems ended up being a 2 person job. I was responsible for designing the server logic, game physics, client-server communication and multithreading. In this [repository](https://github.com/FelipeAscencio/DuckGame-Remake) you will find the complete project alongside documentation, including user manuals and project reports explaining with detail my role in the project.
* Developed in C++ using SDL2 and SDL2pp
* Multithreading

### Solitaire
Developed using Java and JavaFX, this project includes the 'Klondike' and 'FreeCell' versions of the game, but with the possibility to add more. I was a main developer, alongside 2 other people, making it a three person project. [Repository](https://github.com/axel-zielonka/Solitario-Java)

### PedidosRust
A distributed application system that models a food deliverying app. This was a group project, in which I was a main developer, alongside 3 teammates. The whole project was developed in Rust. [Repository](https://github.com/axel-zielonka/TPS-Concurrente/tree/main/TP2)

### Steam Reviews 
An individual project in which I received a file (8GB) with steam reviews and I had to analyse the data and produce and output using the 'ForkJoin' model. [Repository](https://github.com/axel-zielonka/TPS-Concurrente/tree/main/TP1)

### CoffeeShopAnalysis
A distributed system that receives 4GB datasets (`.csv` files) and analyses said data to return an output to the client. I was a main developer, alongside two other classmates. Some specifications about this project:
* Developed in Python
* Docker used to simulate multicomputing. `docker-compose` file was generated dynamically reading from an `env` file.
* Containers were connected to the same Docker network and communicated using sockets and `RabbitMQ` queues and exchanges.
* Multiclient.
* Scalable. An `env` file was provided to adjust dynamically the amount of containers of each type.
* Fault resistance. The system is fault-tolerant and is able to recuperate itself from failures

### Other academic projects
* Solved problems using greedy, backtracking and dynamic programming algorithms (Python)
* Abstract Data Types such as Queue, Stack, Linked List, Binary Search Trees (C++, Java)
